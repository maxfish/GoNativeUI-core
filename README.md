*Heavily WIP / Not ready for use*

# GoNativeUI
Pure Go, no dependecies, cross-platform, barebone, retained-mode GUI.
The primary goal of the library is to provide a simple-to-use GUI for cross-platform desktop tools.

These are not goals of this project:
* Create a GUI which can be set up with a couple of lines of code
* Target Javascript, Electron, mobile phones, ...
* Provide an extensive set of Layouts or a complete widgets set similar to: QT, GTK, ...

## Core
The core repository contains the logic code of the GUI and it does **not** contain rendering code. A backend for GLFW/OpenGL is WIP.

## Widgets currently available
* Label
* Button
